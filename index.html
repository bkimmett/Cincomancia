<p>Click to cycle through statuses.</p>
<p>MINT GREEN means that you think this <i>could</i> happen on the next wand zap. You can use it to mark all the possibilities for your next move before you make it.</p>
<p>TEAL means tested absent. If tested only until a certain slot, click the slot to assign. LIGHT TEAL means partly tested.</p>
<p style="font-style:italic">For example, if you get <span style="font-style:normal">Impar e Par</span> where you could've gotten <span style="font-style:normal">Alvo Preciso</span>, you can only conclude <span style="font-style:normal">Alvo Preciso</span> isn't in the slots before <span style="font-style:normal">Impar e Par</span>. Click <span style="font-style:normal">Alvo Preciso</span> to make it TEAL, then click the slot containing <span style="font-style:normal">Impar e Par</span> to change <span style="font-style:normal">Alvo Preciso</span> to LIGHT TEAL.</p>
<p>RED means present. Click a slot to assign. Click the numeral to reassign.</p>
<p>BLUE means ruled out by exclusion and sequence rules. LIGHT BLUE means ruled out for at least half of the remaining slots OR diminished probability due to another instance of the effect on another wand.</p>
<p>PURPLE means forgotten. You can use it temporarily to visualize consequences. LIGHT PURPLE means ruled out for slots that have not been forgotten.</p>
